            If you are using the HTML5 doctype or an HTML 4.01 doctype, you can use whatever style you want
            If you are using an XHTML doctype, you need to use XML well-formed syntax
            Whichever style you are using, best practice is to:
            Close all open elements, so for example <p>paragraph</p>, not <p>paragraph
            Nest them properly, for example <p>paragraph with bold <strong>word</strong></p>, not <p>paragraph with bold <strong>word</p></strong>
        </pre>
    </h1>
